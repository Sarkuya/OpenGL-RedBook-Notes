# OpenGL-RedBook-Notes #

Sample codes on the OpenGL red book, and docs on OpenGL.

Documentation is made by using Markdown.

## About This Project ##

OpenGL is a great API for computer graphics computing. However, it is not easy to learn at all for the following reasons:

* You should have some knowlege of Maths
* OpenGL has lots of functions
* From 3.1, fixed-pipeline functions are abandoned and Shader is in favour

In order to learn OpenGL programming efficiently, this project is made. The project aims 3 goals:

1. Providing a runnable envirenment
2. Noting as much as possible from aspect of a OpenGL beginner
3. Doing research by getting your hand dirty

## About Sample Codes ##

All sample codes comes from the OpenGL Programming Guide, Eighth Edition, The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.3.

Some modification of the sample codes are made for lessening learning curves.

## Environment Preparation ##

You are considered as having previously installed the following components:

* Visual Studio Commuity 2013
* Visual Studio Markdown Mode Extension
* freeglut
* glew

## Usage ##

1. Fork, clone or download the project.
2. Double-click on the OpenGLRedbookNotes.sln in the root directory to open the solution in Visual Studio.
